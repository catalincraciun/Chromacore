### What we have changed

* Changes in gameplay
  * We have changed a lot here, we have made the gameplay infinite by creating a very efficient and bug-free generation mechanism
  * We have changed the way Teli dies
  * We added a new concept that gives Teli a second chance, now Teli shouldn't fall behind the camera. Every obstacle he fails to avoid leaves him back. When he is out of the camera, the game is over.
* Changes in graphics
  * We have changed the buildings in the background
  * We have added brand new structures on which the main character steps
  * We have darkened everything, including the main character and the balls (now they are called mistic balls)
  * We have darkened and reduced the character in size, it looks better now
  * We have added dynamic flashy lights to create a beautiful atmosphere
* Changes in UI
  * We have added an instructions scene and a stunning menu with automatic gameplay on the background
* Changes in logic
  * We have fixed a very countable number of bugs

<br></br>
In short, we have turned a quite buggy game into a good looking, bug-free and addictive piece of art while destroying the core game design that made Chromacore interesting.  The original authors released an updated version post-GitHub Game Off, [here](https://github.com/Murkantilism/Chromacore), preserving what made the game fun to begin with.

## The Team
The project was briefly continued by a two-member motivated team:
- Code: Catalin Craciun
- Art: Domide Bogdan
